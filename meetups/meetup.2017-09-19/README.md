# Content from the second docker limerick meetup - Septemper 19th 2017

## Topic: Jenkins, CI, Docker

In this meet-up we discussed how Jenkins build environments can overtime become increasingly more difficult to manage. When Build dependencies conflict with other projects new build agents/ nodes need to be created, adding more complexity. In this talk, We propose moving the `Build & Test` stages of your CI pipeline into a containerised environment, removing the build dependencies from your Jenkins build environments and also having the added bonus of being executable locally. 

Each project contains a Markdown README.
